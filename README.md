Greetings. I am Leina.
I go by She/Her and I generally keep to myself.
I'll open github every once in a while for FOSS software, but there is an occasion where I'll
log in to here to actually suggest code changes and help write something, It's not often, though.

Acceleration2299/Acceleration2299 is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
